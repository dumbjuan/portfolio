        <p class="mystory">
        I am B-art, a student, and an artist. I currently live in Davao City, Philippines, where I study Media Arts under Arts and Design Track. Being a media art student gives you many challenges and opportunities which seek to develop your skills and abilities. My journey may have been rough, but I take pride and humility in my progress as a media student.


        <br> <br>I developed my love for video editing when I was 11 years old. I was making videos as a hobby at the time, ranging from lyric videos to parodies of tv shows. As I grew old, my love for video production also progressed. In fact, I began utilising my video editing skills on school projects during my junior high school days. Videos ranging from presentation videos, music videos, and even short films were among the projects that I worked on.

        <br> <br>Moreover, I was fulfilled and happy to have received all the feedback from my family, teachers, and friends. It fueled me to continue hence developing a passion for video editing. However, in 2020, the pandemic's peak started a new chapter for my media art journey. <br>

            </div>    

        <br><br><p class="mystory">In 2020, one of my subject teachers contacted me to edit for an event on our campus. I was thrilled and excited when I got the project. I made my utmost effort for this event, thus making it my first big successful project. Afterwards, projects from the campus kept coming, which further added to my experience and abilities. However, it was not a walk in the park. Throughout this time, I experienced a lot of anxiety and pressure. Not only was I struggling to balance my academics and extra-curricular activities, but I was also faced with many demands. This caused me a lot of pressure to deliver with all the expectations placed on me. But I was determined to continue, accepting all the challenges with strength and determination.

        <br><br><p class="mystory">Eventually, I completed junior high school, and I’m now a media art student in senior high school. I’m leading Lantaw Productions, a school-based media production on our campus. On this day, we conducted some events and documented several activities on campus. Together with my team, we strive to give out the best output for the students while seeking the see the best of our skills.

        <br><br>In conclusion, I am honored and grateful to be where I am now. From making lyric videos to producing large-scale projects on our campus, I am beyond proud and thankful for all my achievements thus far. Although my journey is yet to be completed, I am optimistic about my future endeavors and development as a media student and, soon, a mass communication student.
